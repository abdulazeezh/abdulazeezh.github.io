           <p align="justify"></br>Sustainable development of the world requires the development of green energy technologies. As the global population is continuously increasing, the need for low-cost and renewable energy solutions are of greater importance. The amount of solar power striking on the earth in an hour is more than annual global power consumption, indicating the potential of Solar cells to meet this demand. Amongst the available solar cell technologies, Organic Solar Cell (OSC) is a promising candidate for green and renewable energy demand due to the rousing features such as solution-processability, semitransparency, flexibility and roll to roll printing production. Despite active research, for more than two decades, OSC’s are far from being successfully commercialized as compared to other Photovoltaic (PV) technologies such as Si, because of low efficiency and poor stability. My research broadly focused on understanding the device physics and degradation mechanism of OSC. This understanding is crucial to design strategies, which can simultaneously improve efficiency and stability. Short energy payback time and better indoor performance of OSC’s as compared to the conventional PV technologies demands a parallel establishment of this state-of-the-art technology along with Si photovoltaics.</p>
